# PyLink
## :computer: Info
This is PyLink, a Zelda like game made with PyGame.<br><br>
Why PyLink? Because you are playing as a female... so it's the opposite of zelda where you play as male.<br>
It is written in Python with PyGame as the main engine and deployed with pyinstaller<br>
It is an top-look RPG, where you can upgrade your stats, kill the enemies, change weapons, spells and things like that.


## :hammer: How to build the project
You can use the app without building by going into <b>src/dist/main</b> and using .exe generated by pyinstaller!<br>
But If you want to build:
- Download PyGame
- Compile the PyLink.py file, compiling other ones without it doesn't result in anything
